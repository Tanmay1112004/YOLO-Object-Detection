## 📌 Features
- 📖 **Interview Notes** – clear explanations of YOLO concepts  
- 🖼️ **Image Detection** – run YOLO on images  
- 🎥 **Video Detection** – apply YOLO on real-time video streams  
- 🏋️ **Pose Estimation** – human keypoint detection (fitness / sports analytics)  
- 🛠️ **Custom Training Guide** – how to train YOLO on your own dataset  
- ❓ **Interview Q&A** – common questions with ready-to-use answers
